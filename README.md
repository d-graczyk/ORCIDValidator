# ORCIDValidator

ORCIDValidator is a tiny tkinter-based tool to validate an ORCID ID length and its checksum. ORCIDValidator is written in Python 3 (3.7)

### Description

#### What is ORCID ID number?

ORCID ID is a persistent digital identifier that belongs to only one researcher. Each researcher can connect their iD with professional information â€” affiliations, grants, publications, peer review, and more. A researcher can use their ORCID ID to share information with other systems, ensuring they get recognition for all their contributions.

#### Why ORCIDValidator has been created?

ORCIDValidator has been written for administration staff at our Institute to help out in rapid testing whether the ORCID IDs that our researchers provide are correct.

#### What it does?

ORCIDValidator checks whether the given ORCID ID has valid length and checksum.

### Prerequisites

To run ORCIDValidator you must have a Python 3 interpreter installed in your system. Also, an .ico image will be required to run the tool.

### Installing

To install ORCIDValidator download the source code and put an .ico image in the 'icon' folder.
